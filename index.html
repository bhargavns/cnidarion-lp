            Building software does not have to be hard, time-consuming, or
            expensive. With the power of our neuro-symbolic AI model, we can
            help you go from idea to functioning prototype in less than a day.

                  Cnidarion currently makes API calls to GPT-4 to generate its
                  code. The code is then run on a server and the output is sent
                  back to the user. We are currently working on a more efficient
                  way to generate code and run it on the server. You will see
                  that your website or application gets rendered in real-time as
                  you type out your prompts. The more prompts you give, the more
                  detailed your website or application will be.

                  prototyping based on market needs, or making quick changes to
                  address customer needs. It is a cost and time effective way to
